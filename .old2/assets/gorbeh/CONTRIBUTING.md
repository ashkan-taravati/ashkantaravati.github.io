# Contributing to Gorbeh Icons
Want to make Grobeh Icons better? These are ways you can contribute:

## Ask for new icon
Though Grobeh is free and open source, we have to follow some certain standards. If you want us to add a new icon, please have this things in mind:
* Search [previous icon requests](https://github.com/IKAcc/Gorbeh-Icons/search?type=Issues) to see if your wanted icon already exists. If it was requested before, +1 it.
* Ask for a single icon. Unless they are strictly related (like left/right arrow), they won’t get into consideration.
* If it is a brand icon you want, make sure it’s notable enough.
* Be specific. General ideas are hard to implement.
* Title your new issue Icon request: `gb_name` (e.g., Icon request: `gb_flag`).
* Please indicate some usage of your wanted icon.
* Include an image representing your wanted icon (single-color is best).

## Report a bug
We can’t claim that Gorbeh is bug free. Please be kind and report issues in the following manner:
* Search in existing issues. We don’t want to get hundreds of duplicated reports. There are even chances that we are already working on that issue you’re facing.
* Try to reproduce issue. Make sure that issue is made up by Gorbeh Icons and not with your other components with a [reduced test case](https://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/).
* Include an example. We can fix bugs much faster if we could lay an eye upon it.

## Code CSS
Please follow these standards if you want to change some CSS:
* Multiple-line approach (one property and value per line).
* Always a space after a property's colon (.e.g, `font=size: 2rem;` and not `font-size:2rem;`).
* End all lines with a semi-colon.
* For multiple, comma-separated selectors, place each selector on its own line.
